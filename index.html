            <p>Felt like "<span>What</span> is this place" is quite easy to find out, but you might be more interested as to what I want it to be, even though the way I wrote that question must not be correct English. But please don't bother with that, I'm afraid what I write in this language is surely going to be a little weird, I'd say the game is to find whether this is intentional or not !</p>
            <p>Jokes and introduction aside, this place might be where my favorite takes will stand for you to simply read, or agree/disagree with. It's also because I like writing, and creating such space could motivate me to do so more often - at least that's what I'm hoping for.</p>

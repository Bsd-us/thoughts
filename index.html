            <p>It is easy to find a lot of things in what you're greener than some other people, but this is usually not the worst about what you could've been doing. Feeling concerned and involved in the cause really fights the fact you're not ready to sacrifice any of these worst things - so called the dearest things to you heart. It is especially hard to even consider this, when efforts are evenly expected from everyone but that everyone isn't consummating the same way or amount. So life goes on, we feel like this isn't going anywhere, and everyone put blinkers on and I think you can relate to such behavior around you.</p>
            <p>I may be far from reality reading anticipation a lot lately but it really strikes me how much the ecology reveals itself so problematic to human nature. Seeing how difficult it is only to shift how we behave, I wonder how we would change our inner selves.</p>
            <p>This has only been a <span>thought</span> of mine, thank you for reading.</p>

            <p>Felt like "<span>What</span> is this place" is quite easy to find out, but you might be more interested as to what I want it to be, even though the way I wrote that question must not be correct English. But please don't bother with that, I'm afraid what I write in this language is surely going to be a little weird, I'll let you find whether this is intentional or not</p>
            <p>Jokes and introduction aside, this place might be where my favorite takes will stand for you to simply read, or agree/disagree with. It's also because I like writing, and creating such space could motivate me to do so more often - at least that's what I'm hoping for.</p>

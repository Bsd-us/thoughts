            <p><mark>T</mark>oday I was thinking positively, about imagination and how it allows us to make our life sensible in what feels like very trying environments. I like to think about our inner worlds, notice unusual behaviors, account for weird ways of reasoning, what we imagine when we don't know something. Sometimes it seems like it's what's left from who we were younger, a little too silly joke most wouldn't have pulled, a small touch of fantasy in our habits. And at wider scale, we are still amazed by what each other creates and I wish we had even more time to share.</p>
            <p>Today in a way, I don't think we're not only selfish, today I feel like it's needed for us to shine and have the strength to fight. And it probably sounds wrong, in this world that needs a change <span>now</span>, but often I'm grateful that you can choose between feeling everything, or being with yourself to heal up.</p>
            <p>This has only been a <span>thought</span> of mine, thank you for reading.</p>

            <p><mark>I</mark> like that idea that dreaming could be that we enjoy a last tour of a fading souvenir being your old self from that time. What's cool with it is that you can always imagine theories explaining your dreams to justify that idea.</p>
            <p>We could imagine why we did remember once, maybe it always gives you a chance to remember that souvenir when you wake up, with quite the drawback being we'd need to struggle understanding it back. Maybe other souvenirs we did not remember were fine to filter out according to our current self, and that's only sad for who you were before, right ?</p>
            <p>Although it is unavoidable, I can't help but think it is sad anyway. It even itself became a memory sometimes, realizing you forgot the souvenir of someone you know you knew, a place you've been, a song you liked. And if that wasn't intentional, if that wasn't because you became someone else, is it because you did not fight enough for it ?</p>
            <p>From a fact, memory can't handle our increasing lifespan. And as much as I like to think we forget because we move on, I'm afraid it is also because it's needed somehow. And like everything, it erodes, it fades, it fails, more and more with time and at some point people around you start noticing. If life is deterministic, if experience is what I am, I can only fear what I'd lose. So I'm not too rude with it, I pray for it to last.</p>

            <p><mark>I</mark>t is easy to find a lot of things in what we're greener than some other people, but I feel like this is usually not the worst about what we could've been doing. Feeling concerned and involved in the cause really fights the fact we're not ready to sacrifice any of these worst things - so called the dearest things to our heart. It is especially hard to even consider this, when efforts are evenly expected from everyone but that everyone doesn't consume the same way or amount. So life goes on, and I'm the first to put blinkers on and ignore whatever could come next.</p>
            <p>Reading realistic anticipation lately makes me realize how much the ecology reveals itself so problematic to human nature. Seeing how difficult it is only to shift how we behave, I wonder how we would change our inner selves.</p>

            <p><mark>F</mark>elt like "<span>What</span> is this place" is quite easy to find out, but you might be more interested as to what I want it to be, even though the way I wrote that question must not be correct English. But please don't bother with that, I'm afraid what I write in this language is surely going to be a little weird, I'll let you find whether this is intentional or not <span class="emoticon">:)</span></p>
            <p>Introduction aside, this place might be where I share some takes for you to simply read, or agree/disagree with. It's also because I like writing, and creating such space could motivate me to do so more often - at least that's what I'm hoping for.</p>
